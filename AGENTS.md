## Guidelines

<!-- Add project-specific instructions here -->

## Testing

TDD workflow, established 2026-08-20. Layout follows `type-review`'s three-layer
split: `engine/` pure logic → `io/` browser adapters → `ui/` SolidJS.

- `pnpm test` — run the suite once. `pnpm test:watch` — watch mode.
  `pnpm test:coverage` — coverage via v8.
- `pnpm typecheck` — `tsc -b`, same check `pnpm build` runs first.
- **`src/engine/`** — pure TypeScript, no DOM, no `localStorage`, no
  `window`. All randomness and clocks are injected (see `engine/rng.ts`'s
  `pickRandom(items, rng)` and `engine/stats.ts`'s `now` params) rather than
  called directly, so every function is deterministic in tests. Default
  vitest environment is `node` — this is where nearly all logic should live
  and where new features should be designed test-first.
- **`src/io/`** — the only layer allowed to touch `localStorage`/`window`.
  Test files here open with `// @vitest-environment jsdom` at line 1 (must
  be the first line of the file; it sets the environment for the whole
  file, not a per-block override).
- **`src/ui/`** — SolidJS components and `router.ts`. `App.tsx` itself is
  intentionally left without direct tests for now — it's kept thin (wiring
  + JSX) and the logic it calls is tested at the engine/io layer instead.
- **`src/layer-purity.test.ts`** enforces the boundary: engine must never
  import from `io/` or `ui/`, and `io/` must never import from `ui/`. Keep
  new pure logic in `engine/`, not back in `App.tsx`, or this test catches it.

### Known gap, not yet covered by tests

`App.tsx`'s `typeChar` does exact character-position matching against a
single fixed romaji string per lesson item (e.g. `"shashin"` — no `"sishin"`
alternate accepted). That's fine for canned word banks, but it's the wrong
model if this ever needs to accept multiple valid romaji spellings for the
same kana (`shi`/`si`, `tsu`/`tu`) or live IME-style conversion — that would
need a real romaji→kana matcher, which doesn't exist yet. Deliberately left
untested rather than locking in a matching model likely to be replaced.

## Shared Memory

**Always write new instructions, rules, and memory to `AGENTS.md` only.**

Never modify `CLAUDE.md` directly — it only imports `AGENTS.md`.
This keeps Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Antigravity CLI (`agy`) on the same
context; Codex and `agy` both read `AGENTS.md` natively.

## Project Structure

- `.claude/` — Claude Code skills, agents, rules, hooks, commands
- `.agents/skills/` — symlink to `.claude/skills/` (Codex skill scan path)
- `.codex/prompts/` — Codex slash-command prompts
- `.codex/hooks.json` / `.codex/config.toml` — Codex hooks/config (optional)
- `.mcp.json` — MCP server registrations (Claude Code + Codex)
